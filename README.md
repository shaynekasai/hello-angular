# Hello Angular

These are AngularJS 1 templates that can be used as a starting point. My intention is to demonstrate different configurations.

Use at your own risk.

## Templates
- starter: extremely simple example used to demonstrate controllers, and models. Controllers are bound to a single app.
- starter-module: same as above, but controllers are bound to separate modules. 
- services: demonstrate services and how to hook them up into your controller so that you can use them
- directives: build out a simple custom directive
- views: how to use ngView
